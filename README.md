# African Mines Directory

##  Examining connections of object collections to mines in the regions of Southern Rhodesia (current-day Zimbabwe). 

## Short summary
The investigation aimed to examine the extent to which digital tools can aid in low-budget and low-tech digitisation and datafication analogue sources; incorporation of extra-UK colonial era data into the energy investigation. 

## Aims and objectives

We used as an example an African Mines trade directory from the collections of Discovery Museum. We scanned the section related to Zimbabwe, then used ABBY FineReader to OCR-capture it. With the aid of ChatGPT and bespoke Python scripts the captured text was restructured into a structured dataset.
